📊 Marketing Performance Analytics Dashboard | Power BI
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing marketing campaign performance using key business metrics such as ROI, ROAS, Conversion Rate, CAC, and Revenue.
The goal is to help businesses understand which campaigns are profitable, which channels perform best, and where marketing spend should be optimized.

🎯 Business Problem

Marketing teams often spend heavily on ads but struggle to answer questions like:
